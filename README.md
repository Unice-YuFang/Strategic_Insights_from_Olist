# Challenges
Challenges in this data set were one of the main motivators for our team to keep pushing us further.
1. Data challenge: Major challenges were faced on the data pre processing with the data cleaning and data merging. Owing to the higher number of tables, combining all of them to form relations were challenging. However, upon multiple iterations of data cleaning and thorough merge strategies, we were able to over come this hurdle.
2. Infrastructure Challenge: While using Tableau, the system was not able to handle large data sets.
3. Inference Challenges: With the data set being restricted to only till 2018, it was difficult to derive insights with generalisation. We did our best to draw parallels between the insights we got with the facts available in the internet
